# Advanced Equipment for Arma Reforger

**Advanced Equipment** is a mod for Arma Reforger, that is still under development. I wanted to create a mod, that allows you to really use equipment like laptops and lamps.

> [!WARNING]
> Use at your own risk. Some parts may change drastically until it's first release.

This project is entirely **open-source** and all contributions are welcome. Feel free to maintain your own custom version, as long as the changes you make are open to the public in accordance with the ([APL-SA](https://www.bistudio.com/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike)).

## Features

- Power Management (missing; currently only power state)
- Interaction Management (Turn On/Off/Standby, Open/Close and Take are supported for the laptop)
- armaOS Terminal (very basic implementation; most commands missing)
- Filesystem Managment (Files, Folders and Permissions, custom executables missing)
- Network Management (missing)
- Logistics Management (missing)
- World Editor Entities/Prefabs (only the laptop)
- Game Master Support (basic)
- "UI on texture" for armaOS computers (missing)
- Localization (very basic)
